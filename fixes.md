## Problems Identified

1. **Message Sending/Display Issues**
   - Messages were not being sent or displayed correctly

   - No message formatting or styling in the chat interface
   - Missing error handling and feedback

2. **JavaScript Implementation Issues**

   - No proper response formatting after database operations

4. **UI/UX Problems**
   - Missing message styling to distinguish between sent and received messages

### 5. General Improvements

## Security Notes

The application still has some security concerns that should be addressed:
- Password storage is not secure (plain text)
- SQL queries are vulnerable to injection in some places
- No CSRF protection on forms
- No input validation on many user inputs

These issues should be addressed in a future update for a production environment.
